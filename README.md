## Code Structure

A basic node js application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `app.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `public/index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
